# CodeMonkeyTurner

Turn based game made with awesome CodeMonkey's course: https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-turn-based-strategy

The game is now developed by myself, after I finished the course. I add new features and assets, 
implement full game flow (menu systems, different levels, winning/loosing, etc.) - which were not part of the course.

In this game player need to complete given missions (i.e. Find and collect a specific item, capture enemy instead of killing, etc.)
