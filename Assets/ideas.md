List of features/changes that MAYBE will be added to the game

- Move action has move limit, and let you move between actions (i.e. you move 2 fields, shoot, and move yet 4 fields. 6 in total)
- When Interact action is selected, it could highlight other interactable objects, even not around you - maybe with some blue arrow pointing to them?
- Things dropping out of Crates
- Ammo packs (with grenades) to collect
- Mission to free the hostage from prison (?)
- POV mode to see the world from selected unit
